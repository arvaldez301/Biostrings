# DECIPHER Tutorial
In this tutorial, you will learn how to perform sequence alignment using the DECIPHER package in R. Sequence alignment is a fundamental step in bioinformatics and is used to identify similarities and differences between biological sequences, such as DNA or protein sequences. DECIPHER is a powerful R package that provides functions for sequence alignment and analysis.

## Step 1: Install and Load the Required Libraries
Before you begin, make sure you have R and the DECIPHER package installed. You can install the DECIPHER package using the following code:
```
if (!require("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install("DECIPHER")
```
To start, we need to load the DECIPHER package into our R session. Use the following code to load the package:
```
library(DECIPHER)
```
## Step 2: Reading the DNA Sequences
In this step, we will read the DNA sequences from a FASTA file. You can either use your own FASTA file or use the provided example file. If you have your own FASTA file, specify the path to the file in the ```fas``` variable. Otherwise, you can use the provided example file from the DECIPHER package:
```
fas <- system.file("extdata", "50S_ribosomal_protein_L2.fas", package = "DECIPHER")
dna <- readDNAStringSet(fas)
```
The ```readDNAStringSet()``` function reads the sequences from the FASTA file and stores them in the ```dna``` variable. You can display the unaligned sequences by typing dna in the R console.
## Step 3: Aligning the DNA Sequences
DECIPHER provides multiple methods for sequence alignment. We will cover two methods: aligning the translation and aligning the sequences themselves.

### Method 1: Aligning the Translation
To align the translation of the DNA sequences into amino acids, use the ```AlignTranslation()``` function:
```
AA <- AlignTranslation(dna, type = "AAStringSet")
```
The AlignTranslation() function aligns the DNA sequences and translates them into amino acids. The aligned sequences are stored in the AA variable.
### Method 2: Aligning the Sequences
To align the DNA sequences without translation, use the AlignSeqs() function:
```
DNA <- AlignSeqs(dna)
```
The AlignSeqs() function directly aligns the DNA sequences without translating them. The aligned sequences are stored in the DNA variable.

## Step 4: Visualizing the Alignment
DECIPHER provides a function called BrowseSeqs() that allows you to visualize the alignment. You can highlight specific sequences or regions of interest. To browse the alignment, use the following code:
```
BrowseSeqs(AA, highlight = 1)
```
## Step 5: Correcting Alignment Errors
If there are frameshifts or errors in the alignment, you can correct them using the ```CorrectFrameshifts()``` function. First, apply the function to the nucleotide sequences, and then re-align them using either ```AlignTranslation()``` or ```AlignSeqs()```.

## Step 6: Saving the Aligned Sequences
To save the aligned sequences to a new FASTA file, you can use the ```writeXStringSet()``` function. Specify the aligned sequences and the output file path:
